fmp-Capsule
===========

The fmp is a simpler 3D-printable capsule for the
[seidenstrasse](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/wiki/Projects:Seidenstrasse) pneumatic tube system.


How to build it
---------------
1. Go to a hardware store of choice
2. Try to get some M3 screws and nuts
	and some plastic tubing with an inner diameter of 70mm (*DN75 HT-Rohr* works fine).
3. Fire up your 3D-Printer and print the lid, top
	and bottom segment of the capsule.
	20-25% Infill works fine and provides enough stability.
4. Cut about 150mm long piece of tube.
5. Press M3 nuts into the top and bottom cap.
6. Drill the holes into the tube.
7. Put everything together.
8. Go get some Mate or something ...
